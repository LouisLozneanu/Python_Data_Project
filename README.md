- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Engineers, with it being in over half of job postings for both roles. SQL is the second most requested skill for Data Scientists, but is still in over half of all job postings for that role.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (aws, azure, spark) whereas Data Analysts and Data Scientists are expected to be proficient in data management tools (excel, tableau).
