### Insights
- Python and SQL are all highly demanded across all 3 roles.
- Python seems to be more prominent in for Data Scientists(72%) and Data Engineers(65%).
- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Engineers, with it being in over half of job postings for both roles. SQL is the second most requested skill for Data Scientists, but is still in over half of all job postings for that role.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (aws, azure, spark) whereas Data Analysts and Data Scientists are expected to be proficient in data management tools (excel, tableau).



## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

### Results

- Python does appear to be increasing right at the end, so one could argue that it's demand could continue to grow after this point in time
- While SQL and Excel flucuate alot, they are still the top 2 skills throughout the entire year
